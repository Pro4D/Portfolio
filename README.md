At the request of some clients, the repositories of their commissioned plugins may be private, however if you would like to view the works that are public you can do so on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/Pro4D)

#### Due to technical difficulties and/or not being able to properly showcase certain plugins to their fullest extent with just a video/picture, I've had to make this written list of all the plugin development work I've done:

- A Minigame queue system aswell as a map selection system.
- Displaying the cooldown of an item ability from the *MMOItems* plugin.
- A troll command that sends packets to a player to place a fake pumpkin on their head that they can't remove for a set amount of time. 
- A highly customizable plugin to setup resource "deposits" (accompanied with a hologram) that a player can collect with a light harvesting animation. After harvesting, the deposit is replaced with a preconfigured "destroyed" schematic.
- A configurable plugin to allow the specified item to open a specific GUI from the *DeluxeMenus* plugin.
- A simple plugin to stop boats from dropping their item counterparts.
- A recreation of the popular minigame "*Prophunt*" from the even more popular Sandbox game **_GMod_**.
- A light plugin which adds commands to increase/decrease/or set a players EXP & Level (seperate from vanilla) that increases various player attributes such as speed and health. These commands can be used by other plugins.
- An addon to another plugin. The original plugin replaced villager models with random player models, this addon creates folders for every villager profession (including no job) and allows server admins to upload a traditional skin file there to be chosen at random when a villager has that job.
- A plugin that adds potion stacking when on the ground, and allows players to display their held item or the contents of their inventory in chat by typing [item] or [inventory] / [inv]
- And various task for a small SMP server
